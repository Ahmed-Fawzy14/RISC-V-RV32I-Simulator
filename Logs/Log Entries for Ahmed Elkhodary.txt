November 3, 2024:
- Developed the initial structure for the RV32I emulator in Python.
- Implemented register setup (32 registers initialized to 0).
- Created functions for basic arithmetic and logical operations: ADD, SUB, ADDI, ANDI, ORI, XORI.
- Added shift operations: SLLI, SRLI, SRAI.
- Set up memory and program counter.
- Created functions for loading (LW) and storing (SW) data in memory.
- Implemented immediate instructions: LUI, AUIPC.
- Developed branch instructions: BEQ, BNE, BLT.
- Implemented halting instructions: ECALL, EBREAK, PAUSE, FENCE, FENCE.TSO with placeholder behavior.
- Created a dictionary (`instructions`) to map instruction names to their respective function calls.
- Developed `read_instructions_from_file` to read instruction lines from a file.
- Added `instruction_splitting` to parse instruction lines into opcode, registers, and immediate values.
- Completed a `main` function to load and parse instructions from a file (`rv32i_instructions.txt`).
- Ensured the program correctly processes and prints the parsed instructions.

File Creation:
- Created `rv32i_instructions.txt` to provide test data for the emulator, containing instructions formatted with commas.
